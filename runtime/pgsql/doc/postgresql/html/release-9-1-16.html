      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)
     </p><p>      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.
      (CVE-2015-3165)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Our replacement implementation of <code class="function">snprintf()</code> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </p><p>      It remains possible that some calls of the <code class="function">*printf()</code>
      family of functions are vulnerable to information disclosure if an
      out-of-memory error occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk
      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.
      (CVE-2015-3166)

      as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Wrong key or corrupt data</span>”</span> (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether <code class="filename">pgcrypto</code>'s specific behaviors
      are likewise exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message.
      (CVE-2015-3167)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect declaration of <code class="filename">contrib/citext</code>'s
      <code class="function">regexp_matches()</code> functions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      These functions should return <code class="type">setof text[]</code>, like the core
      functions they are wrappers for; but they were incorrectly declared as
      returning just <code class="type">text[]</code>.  This mistake had two results: first,
      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <code class="literal">g</code> flag
      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </p><p>      While the latter behavior is clearly a bug, there might be applications
      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.5.
      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of
      the <code class="literal">citext</code> extension, while we have provided corrected
      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> installed by
      default).  To adopt the fix in pre-9.5 branches, execute
      <code class="literal">ALTER EXTENSION citext UPDATE TO '1.1'</code> in each database in
      which <code class="literal">citext</code> is installed.  (You can also <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">update</span>”</span>
      back to 1.0 if you need to undo that.)  Be aware that either update
      direction will require dropping and recreating any views or rules that
      use <code class="filename">citext</code>'s <code class="function">regexp_matches()</code> functions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect checking of deferred exclusion constraints after a HOT
      update (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If a new row that potentially violates a deferred exclusion constraint
      is HOT-updated (that is, no indexed columns change and the row can be
      stored back onto the same table page) later in the same transaction,
      the exclusion constraint would be reported as violated when the check
      finally occurred, even if the row(s) the new row originally conflicted
      with had been deleted.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent improper reordering of antijoins (NOT EXISTS joins) versus
      other outer joins (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This oversight in the planner has been observed to cause <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could
      not find RelOptInfo for given relids</span>”</span> errors, but it seems possible
      that sometimes an incorrect query plan might get past that consistency
      check and result in silently-wrong query output.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect matching of subexpressions in outer-join plan nodes
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Previously, if textually identical non-strict subexpressions were used
      both above and below an outer join, the planner might try to re-use
      the value computed below the join, which would be incorrect because the
      executor would force the value to NULL in case of an unmatched outer row.

      a transaction that was read-only so far as the user is concerned
      (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      Previously, a delay could occur at commit in transactions that had
      written WAL due to HOT page pruning, leading to undesirable effects
      such as sessions getting stuck at startup if all synchronous replicas
      are down.  Sessions have also been observed to get stuck in catchup
      interrupt processing when using synchronous replication; this will fix
      that problem as well.

      Kerberos/GSSAPI/SSPI authentication (Stephen Frost)
     </p><p>      Without this, identically-named users from different realms cannot be
      distinguished.  For the moment this is only a documentation change, but
      it will become the default setting in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.5.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Remove code for matching IPv4 <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> entries to
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

      replication command (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This avoids a possible startup failure
      in <span class="application">pg_receivexlog</span>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      While shutting down service on Windows, periodically send status
      updates to the Service Control Manager to prevent it from killing the

      shutdown (Krystian Bigaj)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Reduce risk of network deadlock when using <span class="application">libpq</span>'s
      non-blocking mode (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input
      buffer every so often, in case the server has sent enough response data
      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <code class="literal">COPY FROM
      STDIN</code>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <span class="application">libpq</span>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
      and be sure to call <code class="function">PQconsumeInput()</code> upon read-ready.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix array handling in <span class="application">ecpg</span> (Michael Meskes)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">psql</span> to sanely handle URIs and conninfo strings as
      the first parameter to <code class="command">\connect</code>
      (David Fetter, Andrew Dunstan, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This syntax has been accepted (but undocumented) for a long time, but
      previously some parameters might be taken from the old connection
      instead of the given string, which was agreed to be undesirable.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Suppress incorrect complaints from <span class="application">psql</span> on some
      platforms that it failed to write <code class="filename">~/.psql_history</code> at exit
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This misbehavior was caused by a workaround for a bug in very old
      (pre-2006) versions of <span class="application">libedit</span>.  We fixed it by
      removing the workaround, which will cause a similar failure to appear
      for anyone still using such versions of <span class="application">libedit</span>.
