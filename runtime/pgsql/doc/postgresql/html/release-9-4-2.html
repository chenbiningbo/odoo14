      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)
     </p><p>      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Our replacement implementation of <code class="function">snprintf()</code> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </p><p>      It remains possible that some calls of the <code class="function">*printf()</code>
      family of functions are vulnerable to information disclosure if an
      out-of-memory error occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk
      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

      as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Wrong key or corrupt data</span>”</span> (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether <code class="filename">pgcrypto</code>'s specific behaviors
      are likewise exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message.

      (Álvaro Herrera, Robert Haas, Thomas Munro)
     </p><p>      Under certain usage patterns, the existing defenses against this might
      be insufficient, allowing <code class="filename">pg_multixact/members</code> files to be
      removed too early, resulting in data loss.
      The fix for this includes modifying the server to fail transactions
      that would result in overwriting old multixact member ID data, and
      improving autovacuum to ensure it will act proactively to prevent
      multixact member ID wraparound, as it does for transaction ID
      wraparound.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect declaration of <code class="filename">contrib/citext</code>'s
      <code class="function">regexp_matches()</code> functions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      These functions should return <code class="type">setof text[]</code>, like the core
      functions they are wrappers for; but they were incorrectly declared as
      returning just <code class="type">text[]</code>.  This mistake had two results: first,
      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <code class="literal">g</code> flag
      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </p><p>      While the latter behavior is clearly a bug, there might be applications
      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.5.
      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of
      the <code class="literal">citext</code> extension, while we have provided corrected
      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> installed by
      default).  To adopt the fix in pre-9.5 branches, execute
      <code class="literal">ALTER EXTENSION citext UPDATE TO '1.1'</code> in each database in
      which <code class="literal">citext</code> is installed.  (You can also <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">update</span>”</span>
      back to 1.0 if you need to undo that.)  Be aware that either update
      direction will require dropping and recreating any views or rules that
      use <code class="filename">citext</code>'s <code class="function">regexp_matches()</code> functions.

      update (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If a new row that potentially violates a deferred exclusion constraint
      is HOT-updated (that is, no indexed columns change and the row can be
      stored back onto the same table page) later in the same transaction,
      the exclusion constraint would be reported as violated when the check
      finally occurred, even if the row(s) the new row originally conflicted
      with had been deleted.

      honor the status change promptly.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix planning of star-schema-style queries (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Sometimes, efficient scanning of a large table requires that index
      parameters be provided from more than one other table (commonly,
      dimension tables whose keys are needed to index a large fact table).
      The planner should be able to find such plans, but an overly
      restrictive search heuristic prevented it.

      not find RelOptInfo for given relids</span>”</span> errors, but it seems possible
      that sometimes an incorrect query plan might get past that consistency

      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Previously, if textually identical non-strict subexpressions were used
      both above and below an outer join, the planner might try to re-use
      the value computed below the join, which would be incorrect because the
      executor would force the value to NULL in case of an unmatched outer row.

      (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      Previously, a delay could occur at commit in transactions that had
      written WAL due to HOT page pruning, leading to undesirable effects
      such as sessions getting stuck at startup if all synchronous replicas
      are down.  Sessions have also been observed to get stuck in catchup
      interrupt processing when using synchronous replication; this will fix
      that problem as well.

     </p><p>      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

      non-blocking mode (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input
      buffer every so often, in case the server has sent enough response data
      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <code class="literal">COPY FROM
      STDIN</code>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <span class="application">libpq</span>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
