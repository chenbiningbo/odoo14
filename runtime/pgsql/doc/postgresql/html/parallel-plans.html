    completion, it is not possible to simply take an ordinary query plan
    and run it using multiple workers.  Each worker would produce a full
    copy of the output result set, so the query would not run any faster
    than normal but would produce incorrect results.  Instead, the parallel
    portion of the plan must be what is known internally to the query
    optimizer as a <em class="firstterm">partial plan</em>; that is, it must be constructed
    so that each process which executes the plan will generate only a
    subset of the output rows in such a way that each required output row
    is guaranteed to be generated by exactly one of the cooperating processes.
    Generally, this means that the scan on the driving table of the query
    must be a parallel-aware scan.
  </p><div class="sect2" id="PARALLEL-SCANS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">15.3.1. Parallel Scans</h3></div></div></div><p>    The following types of parallel-aware table scans are currently supported.

  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>        In a <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel sequential scan</em></span>, the table's blocks will
        be divided among the cooperating processes.  Blocks are handed out one
        at a time, so that access to the table remains sequential.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>        In a <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel bitmap heap scan</em></span>, one process is chosen
        as the leader.  That process performs a scan of one or more indexes
        and builds a bitmap indicating which table blocks need to be visited.
        These blocks are then divided among the cooperating processes as in
        a parallel sequential scan.  In other words, the heap scan is performed
        in parallel, but the underlying index scan is not.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>        In a <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel index scan</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel index-only
        scan</em></span>, the cooperating processes take turns reading data from the
        index.  Currently, parallel index scans are supported only for
        btree indexes.  Each process will claim a single index block and will
        scan and return all tuples referenced by that block; other process can
        at the same time be returning tuples from a different index block.
        The results of a parallel btree scan are returned in sorted order
        within each worker process.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>

    Other scan types, such as scans of non-btree indexes, may support
    parallel scans in the future.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" id="PARALLEL-JOINS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">15.3.2. Parallel Joins</h3></div></div></div><p>    Just as in a non-parallel plan, the driving table may be joined to one or
    more other tables using a nested loop, hash join, or merge join.  The
    inner side of the join may be any kind of non-parallel plan that is
    otherwise supported by the planner provided that it is safe to run within
    a parallel worker.  For example, if a nested loop join is chosen, the
    inner plan may be an index scan which looks up a value taken from the outer
    side of the join.
  </p><p>    Each worker will execute the inner side of the join in full.  This is
    typically not a problem for nested loops, but may be inefficient for
    cases involving hash or merge joins.  For example, for a hash join, this
    restriction means that an identical hash table is built in each worker
    process, which works fine for joins against small tables but may not be
    efficient when the inner table is large.  For a merge join, it might mean
    that each worker performs a separate sort of the inner relation, which
    could be slow.  Of course, in cases where a parallel plan of this type
    would be inefficient, the query planner will normally choose some other
    plan (possibly one which does not use parallelism) instead.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" id="PARALLEL-AGGREGATION"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">15.3.3. Parallel Aggregation</h3></div></div></div><p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports parallel aggregation by aggregating in
    two stages.  First, each process participating in the parallel portion of
    the query performs an aggregation step, producing a partial result for
    each group of which that process is aware.  This is reflected in the plan
    as a <code class="literal">Partial Aggregate</code> node.  Second, the partial results are
    transferred to the leader via <code class="literal">Gather</code> or <code class="literal">Gather
    Merge</code>.  Finally, the leader re-aggregates the results across all
    workers in order to produce the final result.  This is reflected in the
    plan as a <code class="literal">Finalize Aggregate</code> node.
  </p><p>    Because the <code class="literal">Finalize Aggregate</code> node runs on the leader
    process, queries which produce a relatively large number of groups in
    comparison to the number of input rows will appear less favorable to the
    query planner. For example, in the worst-case scenario the number of
    groups seen by the <code class="literal">Finalize Aggregate</code> node could be as many as
    the number of input rows which were seen by all worker processes in the
    <code class="literal">Partial Aggregate</code> stage. For such cases, there is clearly
    going to be no performance benefit to using parallel aggregation. The
    query planner takes this into account during the planning process and is
    unlikely to choose parallel aggregate in this scenario.
  </p><p>    Parallel aggregation is not supported in all situations.  Each aggregate
    must be <a class="link" href="parallel-safety.html" title="15.4. Parallel Safety">safe</a> for parallelism and must
    have a combine function.  If the aggregate has a transition state of type
    <code class="literal">internal</code>, it must have serialization and deserialization
    functions.  See <a class="xref" href="sql-createaggregate.html" title="CREATE AGGREGATE"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE AGGREGATE</span></a> for more details.
    Parallel aggregation is not supported if any aggregate function call
    contains <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code> or <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> clause and is also
    not supported for ordered set aggregates or when  the query involves
    <code class="literal">GROUPING SETS</code>.  It can only be used when all joins involved in
    the query are also part of the parallel portion of the plan.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" id="PARALLEL-PLAN-TIPS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">15.3.4. Parallel Plan Tips</h3></div></div></div><p>    If a query that is expected to do so does not produce a parallel plan,
    you can try reducing <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-PARALLEL-SETUP-COST">parallel_setup_cost</a> or
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-PARALLEL-TUPLE-COST">parallel_tuple_cost</a>.  Of course, this plan may turn
    out to be slower than the serial plan which the planner preferred, but
    this will not always be the case.  If you don't get a parallel
    plan even with very small values of these settings (e.g. after setting
    them both to zero), there may be some reason why the query planner is
    unable to generate a parallel plan for your query.  See
    <a class="xref" href="when-can-parallel-query-be-used.html" title="15.2. When Can Parallel Query Be Used?">Section 15.2</a> and
    <a class="xref" href="parallel-safety.html" title="15.4. Parallel Safety">Section 15.4</a> for information on why this may be
    the case.
  </p><p>    When executing a parallel plan, you can use <code class="literal">EXPLAIN (ANALYZE,
    VERBOSE)</code> to display per-worker statistics for each plan node.
    This may be useful in determining whether the work is being evenly
    distributed between all plan nodes and more generally in understanding the
    performance characteristics of the plan.
