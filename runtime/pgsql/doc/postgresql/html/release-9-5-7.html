      of <code class="structname">pg_user_mappings</code>.<code class="structfield">umoptions</code>, to
      protect passwords stored as user mapping options
      (Michael Paquier, Feike Steenbergen)
     </p><p>      The previous coding allowed the owner of a foreign server object,
      or anyone he has granted server <code class="literal">USAGE</code> permission to,
      to see the options for all user mappings associated with that server.
      This might well include passwords for other users.
      Adjust the view definition to match the behavior of
      <code class="structname">information_schema.user_mapping_options</code>, namely that
      these options are visible to the user being mapped, or if the mapping
      is for <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> and the current user is the server
      owner, or if the current user is a superuser.
      (CVE-2017-7486)
     </p><p>      By itself, this patch will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd
      databases.  If you wish to apply this change in an existing database,
      follow the corrected procedure shown in the changelog entry for
      CVE-2017-7547, in <a class="xref" href="release-9-5-8.html" title="E.21. Release 9.5.8">Section E.21</a>.

      (Peter Eisentraut)
     </p><p>      Some selectivity estimation functions in the planner will apply
      user-defined operators to values obtained
      from <code class="structname">pg_statistic</code>, such as most common values and
      histogram entries.  This occurs before table permissions are checked,
      so a nefarious user could exploit the behavior to obtain these values
      for table columns he does not have permission to read.  To fix,
      fall back to a default estimate if the operator's implementation
      function is not certified leak-proof and the calling user does not have
      permission to read the table column whose statistics are needed.
      At least one of these criteria is satisfied in most cases in practice.

      the <code class="envar">PGREQUIRESSL</code> environment variable (Daniel Gustafsson)
     </p><p>      Processing of this environment variable was unintentionally dropped
      in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.3, but its documentation remained.
      This creates a security hazard, since users might be relying on the
      environment variable to force SSL-encrypted connections, but that
      would no longer be guaranteed.  Restore handling of the variable,
      but give it lower priority than <code class="envar">PGSSLMODE</code>, to avoid
      breaking configurations that work correctly with post-9.3 code.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possibly-invalid initial snapshot during logical decoding
      (Petr Jelinek, Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      The initial snapshot created for a logical decoding replication slot
      was potentially incorrect.  This could cause third-party tools that
      use logical decoding to copy incomplete/inconsistent initial data.
      This was more likely to happen if the source server was busy at the
      time of slot creation, or if another logical slot already existed.
     </p><p>      If you are using a replication tool that depends on logical decoding,
      and it should have copied a nonempty data set at the start of
      replication, it is advisable to recreate the replica after
      installing this update, or to verify its contents against the source
      server.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible corruption of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">init forks</span>”</span> of unlogged indexes
      (Robert Haas, Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      This could result in an unlogged index being set to an invalid state
      after a crash and restart.  Such a problem would persist until the
      index was dropped and rebuilt.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect reconstruction of <code class="structname">pg_subtrans</code> entries
      when a standby server replays a prepared but uncommitted two-phase
      transaction (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In most cases this turned out to have no visible ill effects, but in
      corner cases it could result in circular references
      in <code class="structname">pg_subtrans</code>, potentially causing infinite loops
      in queries that examine rows modified by the two-phase transaction.

      background worker process (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Previously, the postmaster updated portions of its state as though
      the process had been launched successfully, resulting in subsequent
      confusion.

      scans (Dmitry Ivanov, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This optimization supposed that retrieving all columns of a tuple
      is inexpensive, which is true for ordinary Postgres tuples; but it
      might not be the case for a custom scan provider.

      row-level-security policy (Stephen Frost)
     </p><p>      In some cases the <code class="literal">WITH CHECK</code> restriction would be applied
      when the <code class="literal">USING</code> restriction is more appropriate.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure parsing of queries in extension scripts sees the results of
      immediately-preceding DDL (Julien Rouhaud, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Due to lack of a cache flush step between commands in an extension
      script file, non-utility queries might not see the effects of an
      immediately preceding catalog change, such as <code class="command">ALTER TABLE
      ... RENAME</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Skip tablespace privilege checks when <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ... ALTER
      COLUMN TYPE</code> rebuilds an existing index (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      The command failed if the calling user did not currently have
      <code class="literal">CREATE</code> privilege for the tablespace containing the index.
      That behavior seems unhelpful, so skip the check, allowing the
      index to be rebuilt where it is.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT</code> to not recurse
      to child tables when the constraint is marked <code class="literal">NO INHERIT</code>
      (Amit Langote)
     </p><p>      This fix prevents unwanted <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">constraint does not exist</span>”</span> failures
      when no matching constraint is present in the child tables.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid dangling pointer in <code class="command">COPY ... TO</code> when row-level
      security is active for the source table (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Usually this had no ill effects, but sometimes it would cause
      unexpected errors or crashes.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid accessing an already-closed relcache entry in <code class="command">CLUSTER</code>
      and <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      With some bad luck, this could lead to indexes on the target
      relation getting rebuilt with the wrong persistence setting.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">VACUUM</code> to account properly for pages that could not
      be scanned due to conflicting page pins (Andrew Gierth)
     </p><p>      This tended to lead to underestimation of the number of tuples in
      the table.  In the worst case of a small heavily-contended
      table, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> could incorrectly report that the table
      contained no tuples, leading to very bad planning choices.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that bulk-tuple-transfer loops within a hash join are
      interruptible by query cancel requests (Tom Lane, Thomas Munro)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix integer-overflow problems in <code class="type">interval</code> comparison (Kyotaro
      Horiguchi, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The comparison operators for type <code class="type">interval</code> could yield wrong
      answers for intervals larger than about 296000 years.  Indexes on
      columns containing such large values should be reindexed, since they
      may be corrupt.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="function">cursor_to_xml()</code> to produce valid output
      with <em class="replaceable"><code>tableforest</code></em> = false
      (Thomas Munro, Peter Eisentraut)
     </p><p>      Previously it failed to produce a wrapping <code class="literal">&lt;table&gt;</code>
      element.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix roundoff problems in <code class="function">float8_timestamptz()</code>
      and <code class="function">make_interval()</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      These functions truncated, rather than rounded, when converting a
      floating-point value to integer microseconds; that could cause
      unexpectedly off-by-one results.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="function">pg_get_object_address()</code> to handle members of operator
      families correctly (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve performance of <code class="structname">pg_timezone_names</code> view
      (Tom Lane, David Rowley)

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix sloppy handling of corner-case errors from <code class="function">lseek()</code>
      and <code class="function">close()</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Neither of these system calls are likely to fail in typical situations,
      but if they did, <code class="filename">fd.c</code> could get quite confused.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect check for whether postmaster is running as a Windows
      service (Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      This could result in attempting to write to the event log when that
      isn't accessible, so that no logging happens at all.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">ecpg</span> to support <code class="command">COMMIT PREPARED</code>
      and <code class="command">ROLLBACK PREPARED</code> (Masahiko Sawada)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix a double-free error when processing dollar-quoted string literals
      in <span class="application">ecpg</span> (Michael Meskes)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">pg_dump</span>, fix incorrect schema and owner marking for
      comments and security labels of some types of database objects
      (Giuseppe Broccolo, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In simple cases this caused no ill effects; but for example, a
      schema-selective restore might omit comments it should include, because
      they were not marked as belonging to the schema of their associated
      object.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid emitting an invalid list file in <code class="literal">pg_restore -l</code>
      when SQL object names contain newlines (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Replace newlines by spaces, which is sufficient to make the output
      valid for <code class="literal">pg_restore -L</code>'s purposes.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> to transfer comments and security labels
      attached to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">large objects</span>”</span> (blobs) (Stephen Frost)
     </p><p>      Previously, blobs were correctly transferred to the new database, but
      any comments or security labels attached to them were lost.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve error handling
      in <code class="filename">contrib/adminpack</code>'s <code class="function">pg_file_write()</code>
      function (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Notably, it failed to detect errors reported

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="filename">contrib/pg_trgm</code>'s extraction of trigrams from regular
      expressions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In some cases it would produce a broken data structure that could never
      match anything, leading to GIN or GiST indexscans that use a trigram
      index not finding any matches to the regular expression.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <code class="filename">contrib/postgres_fdw</code>,
      transmit query cancellation requests to the remote server
      (Michael Paquier, Etsuro Fujita)
     </p><p>      Previously, a local query cancellation request did not cause an
      already-sent remote query to terminate early.  This is a back-patch
      of work originally done for 9.6.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Sync our copy of the timezone library with IANA release tzcode2017b
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This fixes a bug affecting some DST transitions in January 2038.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Update time zone data files to <span class="application">tzdata</span> release 2017b
      for DST law changes in Chile, Haiti, and Mongolia, plus historical
      corrections for Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Liberia, and Spain.
      Switch to numeric abbreviations for numerous time zones in South
      America, the Pacific and Indian oceans, and some Asian and Middle
      Eastern countries.
     </p><p>      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.
      But they will not be shown in the <code class="structname">pg_timezone_names</code>
      view nor used for output.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Use correct daylight-savings rules for POSIX-style time zone names
      in MSVC builds (David Rowley)
     </p><p>      The Microsoft MSVC build scripts neglected to install
      the <code class="filename">posixrules</code> file in the timezone directory tree.
      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <code class="literal">US/Eastern</code> zone.  If you don't want that, remove
      the <code class="filename">posixrules</code> file, or replace it with a copy of some
      other zone file (see <a class="xref" href="datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-TIMEZONES" title="8.5.3. Time Zones">Section 8.5.3</a>).  Note that
      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes
      to take effect.
