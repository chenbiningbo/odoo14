     </p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>    Bruce Momjian wrote the following notes to introduce the new release.
   </p></div><p>   There are some general 6.3 issues that I want to mention.  These are
   only the big items that cannot be described in one sentence.  A review
   of the detailed changes list is still needed.
  </p><p>   First, we now have subselects.  Now that we have them, I would like to
   mention that without subselects, SQL is a very limited language.
   Subselects are a major feature, and you should review your code for
   places where subselects provide a better solution for your queries.  I
   think you will find that there are more uses for subselects than you might
   think.  Vadim has put us on the big SQL map with subselects, and fully
   functional ones too.  The only thing you cannot do with subselects is to
   use them in the target list.
  </p><p>   Second, 6.3 uses Unix domain sockets rather than TCP/IP by default.  To
   enable connections from other machines, you have to use the new
   postmaster -i option, and of course edit <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>.  Also, for this
   reason, the format of <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> has changed.
  </p><p>   Third, <code class="type">char()</code> fields will now allow faster access than <code class="type">varchar()</code> or
   <code class="type">text</code>. Specifically, the <code class="type">text</code> and <code class="type">varchar()</code> have a penalty for access to
   any columns after the first column of this type.  <code class="type">char()</code> used to also
   have this access penalty, but it no longer does.  This might suggest that
   you redesign some of your tables, especially if you have short character
   columns that you have defined as <code class="type">varchar()</code> or <code class="type">text</code>.  This and other
   changes make 6.3 even faster than earlier releases.
  </p><p>   We now have passwords definable independent of any Unix file.  There are
   new SQL USER commands.
   See the <em class="citetitle">Administrator's Guide</em> for more
   information.  There is a new table, pg_shadow, which is used to store
   user information and user passwords, and it by default only SELECT-able
   by the <span class="systemitem">postgres</span> super-user.  pg_user is now a view of pg_shadow, and is
   SELECT-able by PUBLIC.  You should keep using pg_user in your
   application without changes.
  </p><p>   User-created tables now no longer have SELECT privilege to PUBLIC by
   default.  This was done because the ANSI standard requires it.  You can
   of course GRANT any privileges you want after the table is created.
   System tables continue to be SELECT-able by PUBLIC.
  </p><p>   We also have real deadlock detection code.  No more sixty-second
   timeouts.  And the new locking code implements a <acronym class="acronym">FIFO</acronym> better, so there
   should be less resource starvation during heavy use.
  </p><p>   Many complaints have been made about inadequate documentation in previous
   releases.  Thomas has put much effort into many new manuals for this
   release.  Check out the doc/ directory.
  </p><p>   For performance reasons, time travel is gone, but can be implemented
   using triggers (see <code class="filename">pgsql/contrib/spi/README</code>).  Please check out the new
   \d command for types, operators, etc.  Also, views have their own
   privileges now, not based on the underlying tables, so privileges on
   them have to be set separately.  Check <code class="filename">/pgsql/interfaces</code> for some new
   ways to talk to <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
  </p><p>   This is the first release that really required an explanation for
   existing users.  In many ways, this was necessary because the new
   release removes many limitations, and the work-arounds people were using
   are no longer needed.
