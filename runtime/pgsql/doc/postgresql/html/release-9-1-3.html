      <code class="command">CREATE TRIGGER</code> (Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      This missing check could allow another user to execute a trigger
      function with forged input data, by installing it on a table he owns.
      This is only of significance for trigger functions marked
      <code class="literal">SECURITY DEFINER</code>, since otherwise trigger functions run
      as the table owner anyway.  (CVE-2012-0866)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Remove arbitrary limitation on length of common name in SSL
      certificates (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      Both <span class="application">libpq</span> and the server truncated the common name
      extracted from an SSL certificate at 32 bytes.  Normally this would
      cause nothing worse than an unexpected verification failure, but there
      are some rather-implausible scenarios in which it might allow one
      certificate holder to impersonate another.  The victim would have to
      have a common name exactly 32 bytes long, and the attacker would have
      to persuade a trusted CA to issue a certificate in which the common
      name has that string as a prefix.  Impersonating a server would also
      require some additional exploit to redirect client connections.
      (CVE-2012-0867)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Convert newlines to spaces in names written in <span class="application">pg_dump</span>
      comments (Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      <span class="application">pg_dump</span> was incautious about sanitizing object names
      that are emitted within SQL comments in its output script.  A name
      containing a newline would at least render the script syntactically
      incorrect.  Maliciously crafted object names could present a SQL
      injection risk when the script is reloaded.  (CVE-2012-0868)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent with vacuuming
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      An index page split caused by an insertion could sometimes cause a
      concurrently-running <code class="command">VACUUM</code> to miss removing index entries
      that it should remove.  After the corresponding table rows are removed,
      the dangling index entries would cause errors (such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could not
      read block N in file ...</span>”</span>) or worse, silently wrong query results
      after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table locations.
      This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs so infrequently
      that it was not diagnosed until now.  If you have reason to suspect
      that it has happened in your database, reindexing the affected index
      will fix things.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix transient zeroing of shared buffers during WAL replay (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The replay logic would sometimes zero and refill a shared buffer, so
      that the contents were transiently invalid.  In hot standby mode this
      can result in a query that's executing in parallel seeing garbage data.
      Various symptoms could result from that, but the most common one seems
      to be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">invalid memory alloc request size</span>”</span>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix handling of data-modifying <code class="literal">WITH</code> subplans in
      <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> rechecking (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A <code class="literal">WITH</code> clause containing
      <code class="command">INSERT</code>/<code class="command">UPDATE</code>/<code class="command">DELETE</code> would crash
      if the parent <code class="command">UPDATE</code> or <code class="command">DELETE</code> command needed
      to be re-evaluated at one or more rows due to concurrent updates
      in <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> mode.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix corner case in SSI transaction cleanup
      (Dan Ports)
     </p><p>      When finishing up a read-write serializable transaction,
      a crash could occur if all remaining active serializable transactions
      are read-only.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix postmaster to attempt restart after a hot-standby crash (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A logic error caused the postmaster to terminate, rather than attempt
      to restart the cluster, if any backend process crashed while operating
      in hot standby mode.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">CLUSTER</code>/<code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> handling of toast
      values owned by recently-updated rows (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This oversight could lead to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">duplicate key value violates unique
      constraint</span>”</span> errors being reported against the toast table's index
      during one of these commands.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Update per-column permissions, not only per-table permissions, when
      changing table owner (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Failure to do this meant that any previously granted column permissions
      were still shown as having been granted by the old owner.  This meant
      that neither the new owner nor a superuser could revoke the
      now-untraceable-to-table-owner permissions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Support foreign data wrappers and foreign servers in
      <code class="command">REASSIGN OWNED</code> (Alvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This command failed with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unexpected classid</span>”</span> errors if
      it needed to change the ownership of any such objects.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow non-existent values for some settings in <code class="command">ALTER
      USER/DATABASE SET</code> (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      Allow <code class="varname">default_text_search_config</code>,
      <code class="varname">default_tablespace</code>, and <code class="varname">temp_tablespaces</code> to be
      set to names that are not known.  This is because they might be known
      in another database where the setting is intended to be used, or for the
      tablespace cases because the tablespace might not be created yet.  The
      same issue was previously recognized for <code class="varname">search_path</code>, and
      these settings now act like that one.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unsupported node type</span>”</span> error caused by <code class="literal">COLLATE</code>
      in an <code class="command">INSERT</code> expression (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid crashing when we have problems deleting table files post-commit
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Dropping a table should lead to deleting the underlying disk files only
      after the transaction commits.  In event of failure then (for instance,
      because of wrong file permissions) the code is supposed to just emit a
      warning message and go on, since it's too late to abort the
      transaction.  This logic got broken as of release 8.4, causing such
      situations to result in a PANIC and an unrestartable database.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Recover from errors occurring during WAL replay of <code class="command">DROP
      TABLESPACE</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Replay will attempt to remove the tablespace's directories, but there
      are various reasons why this might fail (for example, incorrect
      ownership or permissions on those directories).  Formerly the replay
      code would panic, rendering the database unrestartable without manual
      intervention.  It seems better to log the problem and continue, since
      the only consequence of failure to remove the directories is some
      wasted disk space.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix race condition in logging AccessExclusiveLocks for hot standby
      (Simon Riggs)
     </p><p>      Sometimes a lock would be logged as being held by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">transaction
      zero</span>”</span>.  This is at least known to produce assertion failures on
      slave servers, and might be the cause of more serious problems.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Track the OID counter correctly during WAL replay, even when it wraps
      around (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Previously the OID counter would remain stuck at a high value until the
      system exited replay mode.  The practical consequences of that are
      usually nil, but there are scenarios wherein a standby server that's
      been promoted to master might take a long time to advance the OID
      counter to a reasonable value once values are needed.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent emitting misleading <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">consistent recovery state reached</span>”</span>
      log message at the beginning of crash recovery (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix initial value of
      <code class="structname">pg_stat_replication</code>.<code class="structfield">replay_location</code>
      (Fujii Masao)
     </p><p>      Previously, the value shown would be wrong until at least one WAL
      record had been replayed.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix regular expression back-references with <code class="literal">*</code> attached
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Rather than enforcing an exact string match, the code would effectively
      accept any string that satisfies the pattern sub-expression referenced
      by the back-reference symbol.
     </p><p>      A similar problem still afflicts back-references that are embedded in a
      larger quantified expression, rather than being the immediate subject
      of the quantifier.  This will be addressed in a future
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> release.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix recently-introduced memory leak in processing of
      <code class="type">inet</code>/<code class="type">cidr</code> values (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      A patch in the December 2011 releases of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
      caused memory leakage in these operations, which could be significant
      in scenarios such as building a btree index on such a column.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix planner's ability to push down index-expression restrictions
      through <code class="literal">UNION ALL</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This type of optimization was inadvertently disabled by a fix for
      another problem in 9.1.2.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix planning of <code class="literal">WITH</code> clauses referenced in
      <code class="command">UPDATE</code>/<code class="command">DELETE</code> on an inherited table
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This bug led to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could not find plan for CTE</span>”</span> failures.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix GIN cost estimation to handle <code class="literal">column IN (...)</code>
      index conditions (Marti Raudsepp)
     </p><p>      This oversight would usually lead to crashes if such a condition could
      be used with a GIN index.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent assertion failure when exiting a session with an open, failed
      transaction (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This bug has no impact on normal builds with asserts not enabled.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix dangling pointer after <code class="command">CREATE TABLE AS</code>/<code class="command">SELECT
      INTO</code> in a SQL-language function (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In most cases this only led to an assertion failure in assert-enabled
      builds, but worse consequences seem possible.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid double close of file handle in syslogger on Windows (MauMau)
     </p><p>      Ordinarily this error was invisible, but it would cause an exception
      when running on a debug version of Windows.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix I/O-conversion-related memory leaks in plpgsql
      (Andres Freund, Jan Urbanski, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Certain operations would leak memory until the end of the current
      function.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Work around bug in perl's SvPVutf8() function (Andrew Dunstan)
     </p><p>      This function crashes when handed a typeglob or certain read-only
      objects such as <code class="literal">$^V</code>.  Make plperl avoid passing those to
      it.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">pg_dump</span>, don't dump contents of an extension's
      configuration tables if the extension itself is not being dumped
      (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve <span class="application">pg_dump</span>'s handling of inherited table columns
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      <span class="application">pg_dump</span> mishandled situations where a child column has
      a different default expression than its parent column.  If the default
      is textually identical to the parent's default, but not actually the
      same (for instance, because of schema search path differences) it would
      not be recognized as different, so that after dump and restore the
      child would be allowed to inherit the parent's default.  Child columns
      that are <code class="literal">NOT NULL</code> where their parent is not could also be
      restored subtly incorrectly.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_restore</span>'s direct-to-database mode for
      INSERT-style table data (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Direct-to-database restores from archive files made with
      <code class="option">--inserts</code> or <code class="option">--column-inserts</code> options fail when
      using <span class="application">pg_restore</span> from a release dated September or
      December 2011, as a result of an oversight in a fix for another
      problem.  The archive file itself is not at fault, and text-mode
      output is okay.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Teach <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> to handle renaming of
      <span class="application">plpython</span>'s shared library (Bruce Momjian)
     </p><p>      Upgrading a pre-9.1 database that included plpython would fail because
      of this oversight.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> to process tables containing
      <code class="type">regclass</code> columns (Bruce Momjian)
     </p><p>      Since <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> now takes care to preserve
      <code class="structname">pg_class</code> OIDs, there was no longer any reason for this
      restriction.

      when looking for an SSL client certificate file

     </p><p>      These functions failed to report certain types of invalid-input errors,

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix one-byte buffer overrun in <code class="filename">contrib/test_parser</code>
      (Paul Guyot)
     </p><p>      The code would try to read one more byte than it should, which would
      crash in corner cases.
      Since <code class="filename">contrib/test_parser</code> is only example code, this is
      not a security issue in itself, but bad example code is still bad.

      Reports suggest that the old code doesn't fail in an obvious way on
