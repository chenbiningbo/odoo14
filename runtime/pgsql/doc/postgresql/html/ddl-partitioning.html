    partitioning. This section describes why and how to implement
    partitioning as part of your database design.
   </p><div class="sect2" id="DDL-PARTITIONING-OVERVIEW"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">5.10.1. Overview</h3></div></div></div><p>     Partitioning refers to splitting what is logically one large table into
     smaller physical pieces.  Partitioning can provide several benefits:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>       Query performance can be improved dramatically in certain situations,
       particularly when most of the heavily accessed rows of the table are in a
       single partition or a small number of partitions.  The partitioning
       substitutes for leading columns of indexes, reducing index size and
       making it more likely that the heavily-used parts of the indexes
       fit in memory.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>       When queries or updates access a large percentage of a single
       partition, performance can be improved by taking advantage
       of sequential scan of that partition instead of using an
       index and random access reads scattered across the whole table.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>       Bulk loads and deletes can be accomplished by adding or removing
       partitions, if that requirement is planned into the partitioning design.
       Doing <code class="command">ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION</code> or dropping an individual
       partition using <code class="command">DROP TABLE</code> is far faster than a bulk
       operation.  These commands also entirely avoid the
       <code class="command">VACUUM</code> overhead caused by a bulk <code class="command">DELETE</code>.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>       Seldom-used data can be migrated to cheaper and slower storage media.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>

     The benefits will normally be worthwhile only when a table would
     otherwise be very large. The exact point at which a table will
     benefit from partitioning depends on the application, although a
     rule of thumb is that the size of the table should exceed the physical
     memory of the database server.
    </p><p>     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> offers built-in support for the
     following forms of partitioning:

     </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Range Partitioning</span></dt><dd><p>         The table is partitioned into <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ranges</span>”</span> defined
         by a key column or set of columns, with no overlap between
         the ranges of values assigned to different partitions.  For
         example, one might partition by date ranges, or by ranges of
         identifiers for particular business objects.
        </p></dd><dt><span class="term">List Partitioning</span></dt><dd><p>         The table is partitioned by explicitly listing which key values
         appear in each partition.
        </p></dd></dl></div><p>

     If your application needs to use other forms of partitioning not listed
     above, alternative methods such as inheritance and
     <code class="literal">UNION ALL</code> views can be used instead.  Such methods
     offer flexibility but do not have some of the performance benefits
     of built-in declarative partitioning.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" id="DDL-PARTITIONING-DECLARATIVE"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">5.10.2. Declarative Partitioning</h3></div></div></div><p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> offers a way to specify how to
    divide a table into pieces called partitions.  The table that is divided
    is referred to as a <em class="firstterm">partitioned table</em>.  The
    specification consists of the <em class="firstterm">partitioning method</em>
    and a list of columns or expressions to be used as the 
    <em class="firstterm">partition key</em>.
   </p><p>    All rows inserted into a partitioned table will be routed to one of the
    <em class="firstterm">partitions</em> based on the value of the partition
    key.  Each partition has a subset of the data defined by its
    <em class="firstterm">partition bounds</em>.  Currently supported
    partitioning methods include range and list, where each partition is
    assigned a range of keys and a list of keys, respectively.
   </p><p>    Partitions may themselves be defined as partitioned tables, using what is
    called <em class="firstterm">sub-partitioning</em>.  Partitions may have their
    own indexes, constraints and default values, distinct from those of other
    partitions.  Indexes must be created separately for each partition.  See
    <a class="xref" href="sql-createtable.html" title="CREATE TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE TABLE</span></a> for more details on creating partitioned
    tables and partitions.
   </p><p>    It is not possible to turn a regular table into a partitioned table or
    vice versa.  However, it is possible to add a regular or partitioned table
    containing data as a partition of a partitioned table, or remove a
    partition from a partitioned table turning it into a standalone table;
    see <a class="xref" href="sql-altertable.html" title="ALTER TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">ALTER TABLE</span></a> to learn more about the
    <code class="command">ATTACH PARTITION</code> and <code class="command">DETACH PARTITION</code>
    sub-commands.
   </p><p>    Individual partitions are linked to the partitioned table with inheritance
    behind-the-scenes; however, it is not possible to use some of the
    inheritance features discussed in the previous section with partitioned
    tables and partitions.  For example, a partition cannot have any parents
    other than the partitioned table it is a partition of, nor can a regular
    table inherit from a partitioned table making the latter its parent.
    That means partitioned tables and partitions do not participate in
    inheritance with regular tables.  Since a partition hierarchy consisting
    of the partitioned table and its partitions is still an inheritance
    hierarchy, all the normal rules of inheritance apply as described in
    <a class="xref" href="ddl-inherit.html" title="5.9. Inheritance">Section 5.9</a> with some exceptions, most notably:

    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>       Both <code class="literal">CHECK</code> and <code class="literal">NOT NULL</code>
       constraints of a partitioned table are always inherited by all its
       partitions.  <code class="literal">CHECK</code> constraints that are marked
       <code class="literal">NO INHERIT</code> are not allowed to be created on
       partitioned tables.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>       Using <code class="literal">ONLY</code> to add or drop a constraint on only the

       as adding or dropping constraints on only the partitioned table, when
       partitions exist, is not supported.  Instead, constraints can be added
       or dropped, when they are not present in the parent table, directly on
       the partitions.  As a partitioned table does not have any data
       directly, attempts to use <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code>
       <code class="literal">ONLY</code> on a partitioned table will always return an
       error.

       <code class="command">CREATE TABLE</code> nor is it possible to add columns to
       partitions after-the-fact using <code class="command">ALTER TABLE</code>.  Tables may be
       added as a partition with <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH PARTITION</code>
       only if their columns exactly match the parent, including any
       <code class="literal">oid</code> column.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>       You cannot drop the <code class="literal">NOT NULL</code> constraint on a
       partition's column if the constraint is present in the parent table.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
   </p><p>    Partitions can also be foreign tables
    (see <a class="xref" href="sql-createforeigntable.html" title="CREATE FOREIGN TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE FOREIGN TABLE</span></a>),
    although these have some limitations that normal tables do not.  For
    example, data inserted into the partitioned table is not routed to
    foreign table partitions.
   </p><div class="sect3" id="DDL-PARTITIONING-DECLARATIVE-EXAMPLE"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">5.10.2.1. Example</h4></div></div></div><p>    Suppose we are constructing a database for a large ice cream company.
    The company measures peak temperatures every day as well as ice cream
    sales in each region. Conceptually, we want a table like:

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE measurement (
    city_id         int not null,
    logdate         date not null,
    peaktemp        int,
    unitsales       int
);</pre><p>

    We know that most queries will access just the last week's, month's or
    quarter's data, since the main use of this table will be to prepare
    online reports for management.  To reduce the amount of old data that
    needs to be stored, we decide to only keep the most recent 3 years
    worth of data. At the beginning of each month we will remove the oldest
    month's data.  In this situation we can use partitioning to help us meet
    all of our different requirements for the measurements table.
   </p><p>    To use declarative partitioning in this case, use the following steps:

    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist compact" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>       Create <code class="structname">measurement</code> table as a partitioned
       table by specifying the <code class="literal">PARTITION BY</code> clause, which
       includes the partitioning method (<code class="literal">RANGE</code> in this
       case) and the list of column(s) to use as the partition key.

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE measurement (
    city_id         int not null,
    logdate         date not null,
    peaktemp        int,
    unitsales       int
) PARTITION BY RANGE (logdate);</pre><p>
      </p><p>       You may decide to use multiple columns in the partition key for range
       partitioning, if desired.  Of course, this will often result in a larger
       number of partitions, each of which is individually smaller.  On the
       other hand, using fewer columns may lead to a coarser-grained
       partitioning criteria with smaller number of partitions.  A query
       accessing the partitioned table will have to scan fewer partitions if
       the conditions involve some or all of these columns.
       For example, consider a table range partitioned using columns
       <code class="structfield">lastname</code> and <code class="structfield">firstname</code> (in that order)
       as the partition key.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>       Create partitions.  Each partition's definition must specify the bounds
       that correspond to the partitioning method and partition key of the
       parent.  Note that specifying bounds such that the new partition's
       values will overlap with those in one or more existing partitions will
       cause an error.  Inserting data into the parent table that does not map
       to one of the existing partitions will cause an error; an appropriate
       partition must be added manually.
      </p><p>       Partitions thus created are in every way normal
       <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
       tables (or, possibly, foreign tables).  It is possible to specify a
       tablespace and storage parameters for each partition separately.
      </p><p>       It is not necessary to create table constraints describing partition
       boundary condition for partitions.  Instead, partition constraints are
       generated implicitly from the partition bound specification whenever
       there is need to refer to them.

      table are not intended to remain static.  It is common to want to
      remove old partitions of data and periodically add new partitions for
      new data. One of the most important advantages of partitioning is
      precisely that it allows this otherwise painful task to be executed
      nearly instantaneously by manipulating the partition structure, rather
      than physically moving large amounts of data around.
    </p><p>     The simplest option for removing old data is to drop the partition that
     is no longer necessary:
</p><pre class="programlisting">DROP TABLE measurement_y2006m02;</pre><p>
     This can very quickly delete millions of records because it doesn't have
     to individually delete every record.  Note however that the above command
     requires taking an <code class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock on the parent
     table.
    </p><p>     Another option that is often preferable is to remove the partition from
     the partitioned table but retain access to it as a table in its own
     right:

</p><pre class="programlisting">ALTER TABLE measurement DETACH PARTITION measurement_y2006m02;</pre><p>

     This allows further operations to be performed on the data before
     it is dropped. For example, this is often a useful time to back up
     the data using <code class="command">COPY</code>, <span class="application">pg_dump</span>, or
     similar tools. It might also be a useful time to aggregate data
     into smaller formats, perform other data manipulations, or run
     reports.
   </p><p>     Similarly we can add a new partition to handle new data. We can create an
     empty partition in the partitioned table just as the original partitions
     were created above:

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE measurement_y2008m02 PARTITION OF measurement
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2008-02-01') TO ('2008-03-01')
    TABLESPACE fasttablespace;</pre><p>

     As an alternative, it is sometimes more convenient to create the
     new table outside the partition structure, and make it a proper
     partition later. This allows the data to be loaded, checked, and
     transformed prior to it appearing in the partitioned table:

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE measurement_y2008m02
  (LIKE measurement INCLUDING DEFAULTS INCLUDING CONSTRAINTS)
  TABLESPACE fasttablespace;

ALTER TABLE measurement_y2008m02 ADD CONSTRAINT y2008m02
   CHECK ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-02-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2008-03-01' );

\copy measurement_y2008m02 from 'measurement_y2008m02'
-- possibly some other data preparation work

ALTER TABLE measurement ATTACH PARTITION measurement_y2008m02
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2008-02-01') TO ('2008-03-01' );</pre><p>
    </p><p>     Before running the <code class="command">ATTACH PARTITION</code> command, it is
     recommended to create a <code class="literal">CHECK</code> constraint on the table to
     be attached describing the desired partition constraint.  That way,
     the system will be able to skip the scan to validate the implicit
     partition constraint. Without such a constraint, the table will be
     scanned to validate the partition constraint while holding an
     <code class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock on the parent table.
     One may then drop the constraint after <code class="command">ATTACH PARTITION</code>
     is finished, because it is no longer necessary.

       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>        Declarative partitioning only supports list and range partitioning,

        the user's choosing.  (Note, however, that if constraint exclusion is

         a suitable trigger function to the master table.
         If data will be added only to the latest partition, we can
         use a very simple trigger function:

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION measurement_insert_trigger()

        </p><p>         After creating the function, we create a trigger which

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE TRIGGER insert_measurement_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT ON measurement
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE measurement_insert_trigger();</pre><p>

         We must redefine the trigger function each month so that it always

         not need to be updated, however.
        </p><p>         We might want to insert data and have the server automatically
         locate the partition into which the row should be added. We
         could do this with a more complex trigger function, for example:

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION measurement_insert_trigger()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF ( NEW.logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-02-01' AND
         NEW.logdate &lt; DATE '2006-03-01' ) THEN
        INSERT INTO measurement_y2006m02 VALUES (NEW.*);
    ELSIF ( NEW.logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-03-01' AND
            NEW.logdate &lt; DATE '2006-04-01' ) THEN
        INSERT INTO measurement_y2006m03 VALUES (NEW.*);
    ...
    ELSIF ( NEW.logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-01-01' AND
            NEW.logdate &lt; DATE '2008-02-01' ) THEN
        INSERT INTO measurement_y2008m01 VALUES (NEW.*);
    ELSE
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Date out of range.  Fix the measurement_insert_trigger() function!';
    END IF;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;</pre><p>

         The trigger definition is the same as before.
         Note that each <code class="literal">IF</code> test must exactly match the
         <code class="literal">CHECK</code> constraint for its partition.
        </p><p>         While this function is more complex than the single-month case,
         it doesn't need to be updated as often, since branches can be
         added in advance of being needed.
        </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>          In practice it might be best to check the newest partition first,
          if most inserts go into that partition.  For simplicity we have
          shown the trigger's tests in the same order as in other parts
          of this example.
         </p></div><p>         A different approach to redirecting inserts into the appropriate
         partition table is to set up rules, instead of a trigger, on the
         master table.  For example:

</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE RULE measurement_insert_y2006m02 AS
ON INSERT TO measurement WHERE
    ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-02-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2006-03-01' )
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_y2006m02 VALUES (NEW.*);
...
CREATE RULE measurement_insert_y2008m01 AS
ON INSERT TO measurement WHERE
    ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-01-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2008-02-01' )
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_y2008m01 VALUES (NEW.*);</pre><p>

         A rule has significantly more overhead than a trigger, but the
         overhead is paid once per query rather than once per row, so this
         method might be advantageous for bulk-insert situations.  In most
         cases, however, the trigger method will offer better performance.
        </p><p>         Be aware that <code class="command">COPY</code> ignores rules.  If you want to
         use <code class="command">COPY</code> to insert data, you'll need to copy into the
         correct partition table rather than into the master. <code class="command">COPY</code>
         does fire triggers, so you can use it normally if you use the trigger
         approach.
        </p><p>         Another disadvantage of the rule approach is that there is no simple
         way to force an error if the set of rules doesn't cover the insertion
         date; the data will silently go into the master table instead.

    that improves performance for partitioned tables defined in the
    fashion described above (both declaratively partitioned tables and those
    implemented using inheritance).  As an example:

</p><pre class="programlisting">SET constraint_exclusion = on;
SELECT count(*) FROM measurement WHERE logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-01-01';</pre><p>

    Without constraint exclusion, the above query would scan each of
    the partitions of the <code class="structname">measurement</code> table. With constraint
    exclusion enabled, the planner will examine the constraints of each
    partition and try to prove that the partition need not
    be scanned because it could not contain any rows meeting the query's
    <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause.  When the planner can prove this, it
    excludes the partition from the query plan.
   </p><p>    You can use the <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> command to show the difference
    between a plan with <code class="varname">constraint_exclusion</code> on and a plan
    with it off.  A typical unoptimized plan for this type of table setup is:

</p><pre class="programlisting">SET constraint_exclusion = off;
EXPLAIN SELECT count(*) FROM measurement WHERE logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-01-01';

                                          QUERY PLAN

 Aggregate  (cost=158.66..158.68 rows=1 width=0)
   -&gt;  Append  (cost=0.00..151.88 rows=2715 width=0)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2008-01-01'::date)

    Some or all of the partitions might use index scans instead of
    full-table sequential scans, but the point here is that there
    is no need to scan the older partitions at all to answer this query.
    When we enable constraint exclusion, we get a significantly
    cheaper plan that will deliver the same answer:

</p><pre class="programlisting">SET constraint_exclusion = on;
EXPLAIN SELECT count(*) FROM measurement WHERE logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-01-01';

   </p><p>    Note that constraint exclusion is driven only by <code class="literal">CHECK</code>
    constraints, not by the presence of indexes.  Therefore it isn't
    necessary to define indexes on the key columns.  Whether an index
    needs to be created for a given partition depends on whether you
    expect that queries that scan the partition will generally scan
    a large part of the partition or just a small part.  An index will
    be helpful in the latter case but not the former.
   </p><p>    The default (and recommended) setting of
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CONSTRAINT-EXCLUSION">constraint_exclusion</a> is actually neither
    <code class="literal">on</code> nor <code class="literal">off</code>, but an intermediate setting
    called <code class="literal">partition</code>, which causes the technique to be
    applied only to queries that are likely to be working on partitioned
    tables.  The <code class="literal">on</code> setting causes the planner to examine
    <code class="literal">CHECK</code> constraints in all queries, even simple ones that
    are unlikely to benefit.
   </p><p>    The following caveats apply to constraint exclusion, which is used by
    both inheritance and partitioned tables:

   </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>      Constraint exclusion only works when the query's <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
      clause contains constants (or externally supplied parameters).
      For example, a comparison against a non-immutable function such as
      <code class="function">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code> cannot be optimized, since the
      planner cannot know which partition the function value might fall
      into at run time.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Keep the partitioning constraints simple, else the planner may not be
      able to prove that partitions don't need to be visited.  Use simple
      equality conditions for list partitioning, or simple
      range tests for range partitioning, as illustrated in the preceding
      examples.  A good rule of thumb is that partitioning constraints should
      contain only comparisons of the partitioning column(s) to constants
      using B-tree-indexable operators, which applies even to partitioned
      tables, because only B-tree-indexable column(s) are allowed in the
      partition key.  (This is not a problem when using declarative
      partitioning, since the automatically generated constraints are simple
      enough to be understood by the planner.)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      All constraints on all partitions of the master table are examined
      during constraint exclusion, so large numbers of partitions are likely
      to increase query planning time considerably.  Partitioning using
      these techniques will work well with up to perhaps a hundred partitions;
      don't try to use many thousands of partitions.
