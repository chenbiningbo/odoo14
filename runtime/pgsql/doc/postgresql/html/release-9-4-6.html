      indexes (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      When processing <code class="type">jsonb</code> values that contain both scalars and
      sub-objects at the same nesting level, for example an array containing
      both scalars and sub-arrays, key hash values could be calculated
      differently than they would be for the same key in a different context.
      This could result in queries not finding entries that they should find.
      Fixing this means that existing indexes may now be inconsistent with the
      new hash calculation code.  Users
      should <code class="command">REINDEX</code> <code class="literal">jsonb_path_ops</code> GIN indexes after
      installing this update to make sure that all searches work as expected.

      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Very large character ranges in bracket expressions could cause
      infinite loops in some cases, and memory overwrites in other cases.
      (CVE-2016-0773)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Perform an immediate shutdown if the <code class="filename">postmaster.pid</code> file
      is removed (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The postmaster now checks every minute or so
      that <code class="filename">postmaster.pid</code> is still there and still contains its
      own PID.  If not, it performs an immediate shutdown, as though it had
      received <span class="systemitem">SIGQUIT</span>.  The main motivation for this change
      is to ensure that failed buildfarm runs will get cleaned up without
      manual intervention; but it also serves to limit the bad effects if a
      DBA forcibly removes <code class="filename">postmaster.pid</code> and then starts a new
      postmaster.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix enforcement of restrictions inside parentheses within regular
      expression lookahead constraints (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Lookahead constraints aren't allowed to contain backrefs, and
      parentheses within them are always considered non-capturing, according
      to the manual.  However, the code failed to handle these cases properly
      inside a parenthesized subexpression, and would give unexpected
      results.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Conversion of regular expressions to indexscan bounds could produce

      (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix regular-expression compiler to handle loops of constraint arcs
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The code added for CVE-2007-4772 was both incomplete, in that it didn't
      handle loops involving more than one state, and incorrect, in that it
      could cause assertion failures (though there seem to be no bad
      consequences of that in a non-assert build).  Multi-state loops would
      cause the compiler to run until the query was canceled or it reached
      the too-many-states error condition.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve memory-usage accounting in regular-expression compiler
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This causes the code to emit <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">regular expression is too
      complex</span>”</span> errors in some cases that previously used unreasonable
      amounts of time and memory.

      in <code class="varname">log_line_prefix</code> work for messages emitted due
      to <code class="varname">log_connections</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Previously, <code class="literal">%h</code>/<code class="literal">%r</code> started to work just after a
      new session had emitted the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">connection received</span>”</span> log message;
      now they work for that message too.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      On Windows, ensure the shared-memory mapping handle gets closed in
      child processes that don't need it (Tom Lane, Amit Kapila)
     </p><p>      This oversight resulted in failure to recover from crashes
      whenever <code class="varname">logging_collector</code> is turned on.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible failure to detect socket EOF in non-blocking mode on
      Windows (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      It's not entirely clear whether this problem can happen in pre-9.5
      branches, but if it did, the symptom would be that a walsender process
      would wait indefinitely rather than noticing a loss of connection.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid leaking a token handle during SSPI authentication
      (Christian Ullrich)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">psql</span>, ensure that <span class="application">libreadline</span>'s idea
      of the screen size is updated when the terminal window size changes
      (Merlin Moncure)
     </p><p>      Previously, <span class="application">libreadline</span> did not notice if the window
      was resized during query output, leading to strange behavior during
      later input of multiline queries.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">psql</span>'s <code class="literal">\det</code> command to interpret its
      pattern argument the same way as other <code class="literal">\d</code> commands with
      potentially schema-qualified patterns do (Reece Hart)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid possible crash in <span class="application">psql</span>'s <code class="literal">\c</code> command
      when previous connection was via Unix socket and command specifies a

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <code class="literal">pg_ctl start -w</code>, test child process status directly
      rather than relying on heuristics (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      Previously, <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> relied on an assumption that the new
      postmaster would always create <code class="filename">postmaster.pid</code> within five
      seconds.  But that can fail on heavily-loaded systems,
      causing <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> to report incorrectly that the
      postmaster failed to start.
     </p><p>      Except on Windows, this change also means that a <code class="literal">pg_ctl start
      -w</code> done immediately after another such command will now reliably
      fail, whereas previously it would report success if done within two
      seconds of the first command.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <code class="literal">pg_ctl start -w</code>, don't attempt to use a wildcard listen
      address to connect to the postmaster (Kondo Yuta)
     </p><p>      On Windows, <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> would fail to detect postmaster
      startup if <code class="varname">listen_addresses</code> is set to <code class="literal">0.0.0.0</code>
      or <code class="literal">::</code>, because it would try to use that value verbatim as
      the address to connect to, which doesn't work.  Instead assume
      that <code class="literal">127.0.0.1</code> or <code class="literal">::1</code>, respectively, is the
      right thing to use.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> on Windows, check service status to decide
      where to send output, rather than checking if standard output is a
      terminal (Michael Paquier)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">pg_dump</span> and <span class="application">pg_basebackup</span>, adopt
      the GNU convention for handling tar-archive members exceeding 8GB
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The POSIX standard for <code class="literal">tar</code> file format does not allow
      archive member files to exceed 8GB, but most modern implementations
      of <span class="application">tar</span> support an extension that fixes that.  Adopt
      this extension so that <span class="application">pg_dump</span> with <code class="option">-Ft</code> no
      longer fails on tables with more than 8GB of data, and so
      that <span class="application">pg_basebackup</span> can handle files larger than 8GB.
      In addition, fix some portability issues that could cause failures for
      members between 4GB and 8GB on some platforms.  Potentially these
      problems could cause unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup
      files.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix assorted corner-case bugs in <span class="application">pg_dump</span>'s processing
      of extension member objects (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make <span class="application">pg_dump</span> mark a view's triggers as needing to be
      processed after its rule, to prevent possible failure during
      parallel <span class="application">pg_restore</span> (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that relation option values are properly quoted
      in <span class="application">pg_dump</span> (Kouhei Sutou, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A reloption value that isn't a simple identifier or number could lead
      to dump/reload failures due to syntax errors in CREATE statements
      issued by <span class="application">pg_dump</span>.  This is not an issue with any
      reloption currently supported by core <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, but
      extensions could allow reloptions that cause the problem.

      and <span class="application">plpython3</span> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In principle, both versions of <span class="application">PL/Python</span> can be used in
      the same database, though not in the same session (because the two
      versions of <span class="application">libpython</span> cannot safely be used concurrently).
      However, <span class="application">pg_restore</span> and <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> both
      do things that can fall foul of the same-session restriction.  Work
